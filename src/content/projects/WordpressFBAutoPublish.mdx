A **custom WordPress plugin** developed for a **news company**, enabling highly personalized **Facebook post publishing** directly from WordPress.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 📢 **Multiple Publishing Methods**

✔ **Embedded Link**: Shares a post with a clickable preview.  
✔ **Colored Background**: Posts text updates with a custom background.  
✔ **Image Gallery**: Publishes multiple images as a carousel.  
✔ **Default Image**: Uses a predefined fallback image.  
✔ **Categories as Hashtags**: Automatically converts post categories into hashtags.

✅ **Custom Backgrounds**: Assigns specific background colors for different categories.  
✅ **Image Commenting**: Adds a comment overlay to images when posting.  
✅ **Smart Cropping**: Automatically crops images for better appearance, especially when publishing 3 or an odd number of images.

## 🏗️ How It Works  

1️⃣ The user selects an article from **WordPress**.  
2️⃣ The plugin formats the post based on the selected publishing method.  
3️⃣ Automation rules are applied (image cropping, link shortening, background, etc.).  
4️⃣ The post is published **directly to Facebook**.  
5️⃣ The plugin monitors post status (detecting deletions and allowing quick management).  

Once activated, you can configure it from the **WordPress Admin Panel**
