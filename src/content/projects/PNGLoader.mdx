A **PNG image loader** implemented in **C** from scratch, designed to explore the structure, encoding, and compression of **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)** files. This project provides a hands-on understanding of binary file manipulation, chunk-based file formats, and the **Deflate compression algorithm**, making it an excellent educational tool for low-level programming enthusiasts. 🚀  

## 🎯 Purpose and Motivation  

The primary goal of this project is to delve into the inner workings of PNG files, including:  
- **File Structure**: Understanding how PNG files are organized into chunks.  
- **Compression**: Exploring the **Deflate algorithm** used for compressing image data.  
- **Binary Manipulation**: Learning how to read and process binary files in C.  

Inspired by the detailed documentation on [Wikipedia’s PNG page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG), this project is perfect for developers and learners interested in file parsing, compression, and image processing.  

## 📚 How PNG Files Work  

PNG files are composed of multiple **chunks**, each serving a specific purpose:  

- **IHDR (Header)**: Contains metadata like image width, height, bit depth, and color type.  
- **IDAT (Image Data)**: Stores compressed pixel data using the **Deflate algorithm**.  
- **IEND (End of File)**: Marks the end of the PNG file.  
- **Optional Chunks**: Additional chunks like **PLTE** (palette) and **tRNS** (transparency) may also be present.  

### 📊 PNG Structure Breakdown  

1. **Signature**: An 8-byte signature at the start of the file verifies it as a valid PNG.  
2. **Chunks**: Each chunk consists of:  
   - **Length** (4 bytes): Size of the chunk's data.  
   - **Type** (4 bytes): Identifies the chunk (e.g., IHDR, IDAT).  
   - **Data** (variable length): The actual chunk data.  
   - **CRC** (4 bytes): Cyclic Redundancy Check for error detection.  

## 🔑 Key Features  

### 🧩 **Chunk Parsing**  
- Reads and interprets primary PNG chunks like **IHDR**, **IDAT**, and **IEND**.  
- Extracts metadata and pixel data from each chunk.  

### 🛠️ **Deflate Decompression**  
- Decompresses pixel data from the **IDAT chunk** using the **Deflate algorithm**.  
- Handles compressed image data to extract raw pixel information.  

### 💻 **Binary File Manipulation**  
- Demonstrates reading and writing raw bytes in C.  
- Provides a deeper understanding of non-text file formats.  

### 🎨 **Flexible Data Handling**  
- Supports multiple color types, including grayscale, RGB, and RGBA.  
- Outputs raw pixel data for further processing or rendering.  

## 🌟 Future Improvements  

While the current implementation is functional, several enhancements can be made:  

- **Additional Color Type Support**: Add support for indexed color and other advanced color types.  
- **Error Handling**: Improve handling of corrupted files, unsupported chunks, and invalid data.  
- **Image Rendering**: Implement functionality to render decoded images directly on the screen.  
- **Optimization**: Refine memory usage and performance for handling larger images.  

This project is a stepping stone for anyone looking to explore low-level file formats, compression algorithms, and image processing in C. 💡💻
