A **semantic search engine** called **ProfileMatcher** designed to find the best match between profiles using **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF** techniques. Built with **Node.js** and **Python**, and orchestrated via **Docker**, this tool ensures efficient profile matching and scalability.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 🔍 **Semantic Search Engine**  
- **Bag of Words & TF-IDF**: Utilizes NLP techniques to rank and match profiles based on relevance.  
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates **Node.js** (profile management) and **Python** (search and ranking) for optimal performance.  

### 📂 **Profile Management**  
- **Add/Delete/Update Records**: Easily manage profile descriptions through the Node.js server.  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Enhances search accuracy with a robust text processing pipeline.  

### 🛠️ **Text Processing Pipeline**  
Before performing a search, text data undergoes:  
✔ **Lowercasing**: Converts text to lowercase.  
✔ **Special Character Removal**: Cleans text for better analysis.  
✔ **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminates irrelevant words.  
✔ **Spell Check**: Corrects spelling errors.  
✔ **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base forms.  
✔ **Synonym Replacement**: Enhances matching by using synonyms.  
✔ **Stemming**: Further simplifies words to their root forms.

### 📝 **Text Preprocessing Pipeline**  
```plaintext
txt to lower → Remove special chars → Remove stop words → Spell check → Lemmatize → Replace synonyms → Stem
```  

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations  

### 🛑 **Lemmatization Constraint**  
- **API Dependency**: Relies on a **Spanish linguistic API** from [Lenguaje.com](https://lenguaje.com).  
- **Request Limits**: The API imposes an **hourly request limit**, which can hinder large-scale processing.  
- **Workaround**: A **proxy server** could mitigate this issue, but it has not been implemented yet.
