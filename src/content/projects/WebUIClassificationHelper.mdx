A **web-based tool** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to efficiently classify **CSV datasets** as part of a **research project** during the **Summer of Science** at the **University of Guanajuato**.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 📊 **CSV Data Classification**  
The tool simplifies the classification process with a **user-friendly interface**:  
✔ **Input Format**: Accepts CSV files with `id`, `date`, and `text` columns.  
✔ **Output Format**: Generates classified data with `index`, `text`, and `classification` columns.  
✔ **Client-Side Operation**: Runs entirely in the browser, ensuring **speed** ⚡ and **privacy** 🔒.  

### 🎨 **Modern & Responsive Design**  
Built with **Bootstrap**, the tool offers:  
✅ **Responsive Interface**: Works seamlessly across devices, including desktops and mobiles.  
✅ **Intuitive Workflow**: Simplifies dataset classification without requiring advanced configurations.  

### 📈 **Efficiency Comparison**  
Comparative tests were conducted against **Microsoft Excel** to evaluate:  
✔ **Ease of Use**: Streamlined workflow for faster classification.  
✔ **Performance**: Handles large datasets efficiently.  
✔ **User Experience**: Provides a more accessible and modern interface.  

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1️⃣ The user uploads a **CSV file** with the required format (`id`, `date`, `text`).  
2️⃣ The tool processes the data and allows the user to classify it interactively.  
3️⃣ The classified data is exported as a new CSV file (`index`, `text`, `classification`).  
4️⃣ The entire process runs **client-side**, ensuring **privacy** and **speed**.
