A **web-based tool** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to efficiently classify **CSV datasets** as part of a **research project** during the **Summer of Science** at the **University of Guanajuato**.  

## üöÄ Features  

### üìä **CSV Data Classification**  
The tool simplifies the classification process with a **user-friendly interface**:  
- **Input Format**: Accepts CSV files with `id`, `date`, and `text` columns.  
- **Output Format**: Generates classified data with `index`, `text`, and `classification` columns.  
- **Client-Side Operation**: Runs entirely in the browser, ensuring **speed** ‚ö° and **privacy** üîí.  

### üé® **Modern & Responsive Design**  
Built with **Bootstrap**, the tool offers:  
- **Responsive Interface**: Works seamlessly across devices, including desktops and mobiles.  
- **Intuitive Workflow**: Simplifies dataset classification without requiring advanced configurations.  

### üìà **Efficiency Comparison**  
Comparative tests were conducted against **Microsoft Excel** to evaluate:  
- **Ease of Use**: Streamlined workflow for faster classification.  
- **Performance**: Handles large datasets efficiently.  
- **User Experience**: Provides a more accessible and modern interface.  

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  

1Ô∏è‚É£ The user uploads a **CSV file** with the required format (`id`, `date`, `text`).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The tool processes the data and allows the user to classify it interactively.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The classified data is exported as a new CSV file (`index`, `text`, `classification`).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The entire process runs **client-side**, ensuring **privacy** and **speed**.
